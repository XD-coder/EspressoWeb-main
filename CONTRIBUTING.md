# Contributing Guidelines

Welcome to the Espresso Hosting web project! Before contributing, please read through the following guidelines to ensure consistency and maintainability across the codebase.

---

## ðŸ§  General Rules

- **No direct pushes to `main` or `dev`** â€“ all changes must be submitted through a **Pull Request (PR)**.
- **Pull Requests must be reviewed** and approved before being merged.
- Use clear and descriptive commit messages (e.g., `fix: resolve navbar animation issue`, `feat: implement login component`).

---

## ðŸ§± Code & Design Consistency

- **Framework**: This project uses **React** with **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Vite**. Please adhere to these technologies.
- **Styling**: Follow the existing Tailwind CSS conventions. Avoid introducing new styling frameworks or libraries without prior discussion.
- **Components**: Reuse existing components where possible. If new components are necessary, ensure they align with the project's design patterns.

---

## ðŸš« Framework Changes

- Major architectural changes (e.g., switching from React to Next.js or introducing new frameworks/libraries) are **not allowed** without explicit approval.
- If you have a proposal for such a change, open a discussion or create a GitHub Issue first.
